# Authentication Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Setup (Production Ready)

The authentication system is now **production ready** and configured to work with your Vercel backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Annoying Popups
- ❌ Removed the "You need to sign in" confirmation dialog
- ✅ Now redirects silently to auth page when not logged in

### 2. Production Auth Enabled
- ✅ Using `auth.js` (production version)
- ✅ Connects to `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register` endpoints
- ✅ All console messages removed for clean production code

### 3. Silent Redirects
- ✅ Profile guard now redirects without popups
- ✅ Saves intended destination for post-login redirect
- ✅ Clean, professional user experience

## Vercel Environment Variables

Your environment variables are already configured:
- ✅ App_name: Kiwi
- ✅ ownerID: 2B.585G@Ao
- ✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

## Required Backend API Routes

Make sure these serverless functions exist in your Vercel project:

### `/api/auth/login`
- Method: POST
- Body: `{ email, password }`
- Returns: `{ success, token, user }`

### `/api/auth/register`
- Method: POST
- Body: `{ email, password, username }`
- Returns: `{ success, token, user }`

## Features
- ✅ Form switching (Login ↔ Register)
- ✅ Password visibility toggle
- ✅ Password strength indicator
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Success/Error notifications
- ✅ JWT authentication with MongoDB
- ✅ Silent redirects (no popups)
- ✅ Post-login redirect handling

## Demo Mode (Optional)

If you want to test locally without backend:

1. Change line 244 in `auth.html`:
```html
<!-- Production Mode (Current) -->
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>

<!-- Demo Mode (For local testing) -->
<script src="js/auth-demo.js"></script>
```

## Ready to Deploy! 🚀

The authentication system is production ready. Deploy to Vercel and it will work with your configured backend API routes.
