**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: No Proper Sign-In/Create Account Flow**
**Before:** User was redirected to separate auth.html page  
**After:** Complete login/signup forms integrated directly into purchase modal

### **Issue 2: No Card Entry or PayPal Login Interface**
**Before:** Immediately redirected to external Stripe/PayPal pages  
**After:** Proper payment entry sections with:
- Stripe: Embedded card input form using Stripe Elements
- PayPal: Integrated PayPal SDK buttons
