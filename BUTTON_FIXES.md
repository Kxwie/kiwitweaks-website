# üîß Button Functionality Fixes

## **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Buttons Not Working** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem:** 
- Most buttons stopped working after enhancements
- Click events were being prevented or intercepted

**Root Causes:**
1. `button-interactions.js` was adding too many event listeners
2. Shopping cart JS was preventing default behavior
3. Global CSS transitions were interfering with clicks
4. `overflow: hidden` was blocking click events

**Solutions Applied:**

#### **A. Fixed button-interactions.js**
- Removed interfering event listeners
- Only adds visual ripple effect (passive)
- Doesn't prevent default button behavior
- Added `data-enhanced` flag to prevent duplicate listeners

#### **B. Fixed shopping-cart.js**
- Removed `e.preventDefault()` from cart buttons
- Cart now works alongside modal functionality
- Added `data-cart-handler` flag to prevent duplicate bindings
- Removed auto-adding cart attributes to all purchase buttons

#### **C. Fixed Global CSS**
- Changed global transition selector from `*` to exclude interactive elements
- Now only applies to non-interactive elements
- Prevents CSS from blocking button clicks

#### **D. Fixed Button CSS**
- Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible`
- Added `pointer-events: auto !important`
- Added `cursor: pointer !important`
- Fixed transform issues that prevented clicks

### **2. Environmental Variables** ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO**

**Issue:**
- Environmental variables disappearing

**Finding:**
- **No code in this project deletes .env files**
- Checked all scripts, no file deletion code found
- `.gitignore` properly excludes .env files

**Likely Causes:**
1. **Vercel Dashboard** - Someone manually deleted them
2. **Team Permissions** - Team member with access removed them
3. **Project Recreation** - If project was deleted/recreated
4. **Git Issue** - Local .env not synced to Vercel

**Recommendations:**
1. Check Vercel Dashboard activity log
2. Review team member permissions
3. Set up environment variable backup:
   ```bash
   vercel env pull .env.local
   ```
4. Add only Owner-level users to project

## **Environment Variables - Action Required:**

Since no code in this project deletes .env files, you need to:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Check if they're really gone or just not showing

2. **Check Activity Log:**
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Activity
   - See who/what deleted the variables

3. **Restore Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Pull from Vercel (if they exist)
   vercel env pull .env.local
   
   # Or re-add manually in Vercel Dashboard
   ```

4. **Prevent Future Issues:**
   - Limit team member permissions to "Member" (not Owner)
   - Enable Vercel notifications for environment changes
   - Keep local backup of all variables
   - Use .env.example as template
